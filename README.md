# Predict-the-default-behaviour-of-small-personal-loan-applicant

A Telecom company, in partnership with commercial banks, is trying to leveraging the techniques of data science and machine learning to understand the behaviours of applicants and make a prediction on whether or not the applicant will default.  


The project is done through a typical data science lifecycle. The code is given in four parts and a detailed report and slides are included as well.
